This project was developed as part of DJSCE Unplugged 2.0 – A Hardware Hackathon, where we designed and simulated a Smart Dustbin & Smart Traffic Lights system using Arduino, ESP32, and various sensors. The goal was to integrate IoT and automation to enhance urban infrastructure.

⚙️ Project Features
1️⃣ Smart Dustbin
✔️ Automated Lid Mechanism – Uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect nearby users and open the lid.
✔️ Fill-Level Detection – Monitors the dustbin's capacity using IR sensors and sends real-time data.
✔️ IoT Integration – Uses ESP32 to transmit fill-level data to a cloud server/dashboard.
✔️ Alerts & Optimization – Notifies waste collection teams when bins are full.

2️⃣ Smart Traffic Lights
✔️ Adaptive Signal Control – Uses IR sensors to measure traffic density and adjust light durations accordingly.
✔️ Emergency Vehicle Priority – Detects emergency vehicles via RFID and provides them a green corridor.
✔️ Remote Monitoring – Traffic data is sent to a cloud server for analysis and optimization.
